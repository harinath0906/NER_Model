# Objective
In this project, I will work on proposing and implementing a model/framework for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using PyTorch. 
I will focus on having a good architecture design & implementation with detailed step-by-step justification while focusing on achieving higher performance.

# Dataset
I will use PART OF the CONLL-2003 from Reuters dataset, which contains a large set of sentences from English news articles with corresponding NER tags for each word.
The dataset is available in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/2020-comp5046-a2/data) where in we are provided with three files (train, val, test).
